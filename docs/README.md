# IDKGame

A small game created with [IDKGameEngine](https://github.com/mellic03/IDKGameEngine/).



## Features To Explore
- Implement a better sparse voxel octree (SVO).
    - Allocate a large buffer upfront and then allocate individual nodes on the GPU.
    - Minimal CPU-GPU data transfer.
- Voxelize all static meshes when loading a level for collision detection.
    - Can be used for procedural animation (like foot placement).
